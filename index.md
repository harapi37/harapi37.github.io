# Index

This GitHub page's main purpose is to host my APIs in simple JSON-format for me. But, whoever wants to, can access and use the APIs, if he's interested. These APIs are not high-level ones, again, they just serve my purpose. I will update them from time to time and may add new ones as well.

&emsp;    Simply a collection of random Joe Rogan quotes (at the moment just a small amount of 10 entries).
