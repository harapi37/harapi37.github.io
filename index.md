# Overview

This GitHub page's main purpose is to host my API/ DBs in simple JSON-format for me. But, whoever wants to, can access and use the API/ DBs, if he's interested. These APIs are not high-level ones, again, they just serve my purpose. I will update them from time to time and may add new ones as well.
